# Riverbed Privacy Policy

Good news: I'm not trying to make Riverbed into a business, so there's no reason for me to do anything with your personal data.

The only data Riverbed collects is the data you save into the app, for the purposes of letting you use the app. Surely doesn't use any analytics, tracking, or data brokering of any kind.

If users start experiencing crashes I may add a crash reporting system that collects data. If I do, I'll ensure it is configured to collect minimal data and store it for a minimal time, and I'll report the details here.

The Riverbed clients and backend are all open source, so if you'd like to be safer, you can build one or both of them yourself:

- [Backend](https://github.com/codingitwrong/riverbed-api)
- [Frontend web](https://github.com/codingitwrong/riverbed-web)
- [Apple platforms](https://github.com/codingitwrong/riverbed-ios)
